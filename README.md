Geological carbon storage (GCS) is crucial for carbon neutrality, 
but requires thorough monitoring and validation due to uncertainties in reservoir characterization, especially in saline aquifers. 
This study integrates InSAR data with deep learning generative models to characterize reservoir facies and porosity, applying it to a channelized aquifer model. 
Using 4,000 geological scenarios and THMC simulations, 
the approach quantifies uncertainties and improves future CO2 plume predictions, offering a reliable tool for GCS modeling and forecasting.
